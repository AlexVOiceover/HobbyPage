This is the first project required for the Founders and Coders application.

Here added a background and some links using external urls

Regarding the Javascript, in order to show today's date we need:

1. Create new <p> element

2. Add today's date to the created <p> element

3. Use querySelector to get the <p> where we will append the date

4. Appen `todaysDate` to the <p> element `dateLocation`
